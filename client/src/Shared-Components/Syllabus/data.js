    description: `We'll begin with introduction to the world of 
    competitive programming —
     the rules, specialties and helpful tips on taking part in
      competitions in general.
      In a separate lesson, we'll learn how to test programs
      : what kinds of test cases there are,
       how to organize the search for a bugtest, and particularly 
       a method of automating testing called stress-testing.`,

    title: 'CORRECTNESS FIRST',
    description: `In this module, we'll start with the most basic
       things you need to actually solve algorithmic problems.
        First, we'll talk about structuring your code and intuition behind
         it — why it's very important, how to manage dependencies between parts
          of different purpose,
          how intuitive rules are enforced through formal invariants and conditions.
           We'll also identify a special class of solutions — brute force solutions
            — which are always correct, but often very slow. And we'll learn how to estimate
             running time of our solutions by using a powerful concept of big-O notation.`,

    title: 'COMMON STRUGGLES',
    description: `In competitive programming, there are a lot of things
       to stumble upon — if you don't know them first! We'll delve into how numbers
        are represented in computers, identify the most common issues with integer and floating
         point arithmetic, and learn to overcome them. We'll also
          discuss how to get stuck less in general, 
         especially when debugging solutions.`,
